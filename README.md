# 3-in-1 Drone: An Educational Robotics Toy

## Introduction
Welcome to the **3-in-1 Drone** project! This innovative toy is designed to **spark curiosity** in children and beginners, making learning about **electronics, robotics, and sustainability** both fun and engaging. It provides an interactive way for users to explore **STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)** concepts while enjoying a **safe and exciting** play experience.

This drone isn't just for flying‚Äîit transforms into a **boat and a car**, giving children the freedom to **experiment, build, and modify** as they learn. Additionally, the **body is made from PLA, a biodegradable and environmentally friendly material**, introducing children to sustainable materials and encouraging eco-conscious learning.

## Modes & Functionality
The 3-in-1 Drone seamlessly transitions between **three exciting modes**, allowing for unique play and learning experiences:

1. **Drone Mode** üõ∏ ‚Äì A fully functional mini drone with four high-speed coreless motors for stable flight. Perform stunts like **360¬∞ flips** and **aerobatic rolls** with ease.  
2. **Boat Mode** üö§ ‚Äì By rotating the motor shafts, the drone transforms into a boat, using its propellers to glide over water effortlessly.  
3. **Car Mode** üöó ‚Äì Similar to boat mode, the motors drive airflow to propel the toy forward on land, making it a fast and fun ground vehicle.

### Features
- **Obstacle Avoidance** ‚Äì A built-in **front-facing sensor (VL53L0X)** helps prevent head-on collisions.  
- **Extra Accessories** ‚Äì Includes **an additional set of propellers and guards** to ensure long-lasting fun.  
- **Safe for Children** ‚Äì Designed with **propeller guards** and **lightweight PLA material** to minimize any risk during play.  
- **Stunt Capabilities** ‚Äì Perform **360¬∞ flips, barrel rolls, and quick turns** in all three modes.  
- **Manual Locking Mechanism** ‚Äì Ensures that motor shafts remain stable when switching between modes.  
- **Eco-Friendly & Educational** ‚Äì The **biodegradable PLA body** introduces children to sustainable materials and teaches them about eco-conscious engineering.

## Quick Start Guide
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assembly & Setup
- Attach the motors securely based on the selected mode.  
- Lock the motor shafts in place for **drone or boat/car mode**.  
- Ensure the battery is fully charged before operation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using the Remote
- The custom remote uses an **NRF24 module** for wireless control.  
- Select the appropriate mode before operating the toy.  
- Features include **joysticks for movement, a mode switch button, a stunt button, and extra programmable switches**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Switching Modes
- Manually rotate the motor shafts and lock them into position.  
- Select the appropriate mode on the remote before operating the toy.  
- The onboard **buzzer** will confirm a successful mode switch.

## üß† Learning Opportunities
The **3-in-1 Drone** is not just a toy ‚Äî it‚Äôs your **first step into the world of real science and engineering!**  
Every spin of its propeller, every turn of its wheels, and every movement on water tells a **story of physics, electronics, and creativity**.

In this section, you‚Äôll discover:
- How **forces, motion, and balance** make your drone fly, car move, and boat float.  
- How **thrust, drag, lift, torque, and buoyancy** come alive in each mode.  
- How sensors, motors, and controllers work together to make things move ‚Äî just like in real robots and drones.  
- The **basics of programming and electronics** that bring your toy to life.
